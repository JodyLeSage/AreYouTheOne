# Are You The One?

Are You The One is a matchmaking reality show on MTV. Season 8 features 16 contestants staying in a Big Brother style group house. Relationship experts have sorted the housemates into 8 "perfect matches," which are unknown to the players. At the end of each episode, the contestants pair up. It is then revealed how many of the pairs are perfect matches, but not specifically which pairs are correctly matched. The goal is to construct as many perfect matches as possible by the end of the season. Each episode also features a visit to the Truth Booth, in which the contestants learn definitively whether a specific couple is a perfect match or not.
